# hark — plan

Milestones. Each one ships something usable and gets a CHANGELOG version.

## M0 — scaffold + ingest (done, 0.1.0)

- Project scaffold: uv/pyproject, src layout, pytest.
- SQLite schema: shows, episodes, topics, episode_topics (extraction fields nullable —
  populated in M1).
- Feed resolution: show names in `feeds.txt` → feed URLs via iTunes Search API (keyless).
- RSS ingest: fetch + parse feeds, upsert shows/episodes (id, title, description, pubdate,
  duration, audio URL). Idempotent re-runs.
- CLI: `hark resolve`, `hark ingest`, `hark stats`.
- Unit tests with feed fixtures (no network in tests).

## M1 — topic extraction + index (done, 0.2.0)

- LLM extraction of subject entities from title/description (stub interface in M0; model
  wiring decided when we get here).
  - Wired to the Anthropic API (`claude-opus-4-8` default, `--model`/`$HARK_MODEL` to
    override, e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5` for cheap runs). In practice no `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    was ever available on the dev box, so the ~2,200-episode backfill was done by hand:
    a Claude session acted as the extractor directly, writing structured extraction JSONL
    across 22 batches, ingested via the new `hark load` command (same canonicalize+store
    path as `hark extract`, just fed pre-computed records instead of calling the API).
- Canonicalization against Wikidata (aliases: "BTK" = "Dennis Rader"); multi-part/serial
  episode handling; multi-genre topics. `hark canon` retries unmatched topics.
- Topic pages: "who covered X" — the core query. Shipped as both CLI (`hark who`,
  `hark topics`) and web UI (see below) — not CLI-only as originally planned.

## Web UI + deployment (done, 0.3.0–0.3.5)

Not in the original milestone list — added mid-stream on explicit request, ahead of M2.

- Dependency-free stdlib web frontend (`hark web`): home dashboard (coverage stats, genre
  breakdown, live indexing-status banner, recently-indexed feed), topic pages, per-show
  pages, genre-filtered and paginated topic listing, search, account/session management.
- Security model mirrors `~/influence-registry`: session auth, HttpOnly/SameSite cookies,
  stretched+salted passwords, fail-closed bootstrap via `HARK_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- Docker packaging (Dockerfile + compose.yaml) mirrors `~/tiltmeter`'s pattern; runs as
  uid/gid 568 via a root→chown→`gosu` entrypoint.
- Deployed live on the homelab TrueNAS box as a custom app.
- Two full audit passes (security + code-quality, then a screenshot-driven UX pass against
  the real dataset) — see CHANGELOG 0.3.1 and 0.3.5 for what each one caught.

## Ad-stripping via adscrub (done, 0.4.0)

Not in the original milestone list. `flan/adscrub` is a separate, standalone
product (its own repo, schema, CLI, deployable alone) that does chapter-marker
scanning, Whisper transcription, LLM ad-span classification, and ffmpeg
cutting. hark depends on it **as a library** rather than duplicating its code
— two products, not a merge (an earlier session actually did a full code
merge here; it was reverted per explicit correction — see CHANGELOG 0.4.0 and
CLAUDE.md for why, and don't repeat that mistake).

- **Why a dependency, not two fully separate schemas:** hark's own
  `episodes` gained `chapters_url`/`chapters_scanned_at`/`transcript_path`/
  `llm_detected_at`/`cut_path`, and `shows` gained `feed_token`; new
  `ad_segments` table. These were deliberately shaped to match adscrub's own
  schema column-for-column, so adscrub's schema-coupled functions
  (`pending_episodes`, `scan_episode`, `transcribe_episode`, `detect_pending`,
  `cut_pending`, ...) work **unchanged** against hark's own `conn` — hark's
  CLI (`chapters`/`transcribe`/`detect-ads`/`cut`) calls them directly. No
  hark-side `chapters.py`/`transcribe.py`/`detect.py`/`cut.py` files exist;
  that would just be duplicated code with its own drift risk.
- **What's genuinely hark's own code:** the CLI wiring (cli.py), the schema
  migration, and `podcast_feed.py` (feed-building — adscrub's own `feed.py`
  targets its `feeds`/`feed_id` schema and has no token concept, so this one
  isn't reusable as-is; not worth generalizing adscrub's version for one
  consumer).
- **Serving:** `hark web` also answers `/feed/<show_id>/<token>` and
  `/audio/<episode_id>/<token>.<ext>` — unauthenticated (a podcast app can't
  do the dashboard's cookie login) but gated by a random per-show
  `feed_token`, not wide open.
- **One shared Whisper model:** adscrub's `transcribe.load_model()` caches
  one model process-wide, keyed by model size. Since hark's CLI calls that
  same function (not a copy), ad-span detection and future M4 episode-scoring
  share one cached instance for free — *as long as* both ask for the same
  model size and run sequentially (they do — cron-scheduled batch, not
  concurrent requests). A future scoring feature wanting a genuinely
  different model size would need to decide that as a real tradeoff.
- **GPU:** `code` has a real RTX 2070 SUPER, Docker's `nvidia` runtime is
  registered; `compose.gpu.yaml` requests it, and hark's own `gpu` extra just
  passes through to `adscrub[gpu]` rather than duplicating the cuBLAS/cuDNN
  package list.
- **Docker packaging gap: resolved (0.6.1)**, via the "small multi-repo build
  script" option. `scripts/build-image.sh` stages git-archive-clean copies of
  `hark/` and `adscrub/` (tracked files only) side by side into a temp
  directory and builds against that as the Docker context; Dockerfile's COPY
  paths were updated to expect that layout (`adscrub` at the context root,
  hark's own files under `hark/`). Plain `docker build .`/`docker compose
  build` run from this repo alone still won't work — the script is the real
  entry point now, `compose.yaml`'s `build:` directive was removed since it
  was never functional to begin with.
- **Per-show toggle + feed URL (0.6.0):** the pipeline originally ran
  unconditionally against every show — no way to exclude a show you don't
  want transcribed (real compute per episode). `shows.ad_stripping_enabled`
  (defaults on) gates `chapters`/`transcribe`/`detect-ads`/`cut`; toggled
  from a button on the show page, which also now displays that show's
  `/feed/<id>/<token>` URL directly (it always existed — every show gets a
  `feed_token` — but was never shown anywhere before this). Required adding
  `adscrub.detect.detect_episode` (a public per-episode function, matching
  `transcribe_episode`/`cut_episode`'s existing shape) since `detect_pending`/
  `cut_pending`'s bulk orchestration has no hook for hark to restrict which
  episodes get processed — hark's CLI now calls the per-episode functions in
  its own loop instead for `detect-ads`/`cut` (same as it already did for
  `transcribe`).
- **Note on where this is configured:** the toggle lives in `hark.db`
  (alongside `feed_token` — same category of per-show config), not `auth.db`.
  That means, like every other value in `hark.db`, it's only durable on
  whichever host is the source of truth for pipeline data — see the "Deploying
  the app container does NOT deploy its data" note in the deploy runbook. If
  the deployed instance's `hark.db` gets wholesale-replaced by a fresh sync
  from the pipeline host, a toggle set only on the deployed site would be
  lost unless also set on the source side.

## Cross-show claims comparison (done, 0.5.0)

Not in the original milestone list either — the natural follow-up to "who
covered X" once transcripts exist: what did each show actually *say*, and
where do their tellings agree or diverge? Lives in `claims.py`, built
additively in a separate session while `web.py`/`cli.py` were mid-merge from
the adscrub port, wired in fully once that merge landed.

- **Comparison, not a raw diff:** a literal text diff between independently
  scripted episodes is close to useless. Instead the model gets all of a
  topic's transcribed episodes in one call and returns which claims are
  shared across shows vs. unique to one show's telling — same structured-
  outputs idiom as `extract.py`/`detect.py`.
- **Own table, not a db.py schema change:** `topic_comparisons`, created via
  its own `ensure_schema()` (same idiom as `web.py`'s `Auth` for `auth.db`) —
  avoided touching the shared schema while it was in flux.
- **Two ways to run it**, same split as topic extraction: `hark compare`
  (live, `ClaudeComparator`, needs `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or
  `hark load-comparisons <file>` (pre-computed JSONL — used the first time,
  session-as-comparator, no API key).
- **`/episode/<id>`** (new route) shows, per topic the episode covers: shared
  claims, claims unique to each show (the episode's own show labeled
  "(this episode)"), or a specific reason nothing's there yet (not
  transcribed / only one show has covered it so far / 2+ shows transcribed
  but not compared yet). Linked from every episode-title cell across the
  site (show/topic/search/home) — a page with no inbound links doesn't get
  used, per the earlier UI-audit lesson about discoverability.
- **Read-only-connection-safe:** `get_comparison()` deliberately skips
  `ensure_schema()` so it works against `web.py`'s read-only `App.db()`
  connection even before `topic_comparisons` exists (SQLite's `CREATE TABLE
  IF NOT EXISTS` still needs write access to *create* it, but is a no-op —
  and safe on a read-only connection — once it already exists).

## M2 — discovery

- **Related shows (done, first cut, 0.7.0):** each show page lists other shows ranked by
  shared topic count (`web.related_shows()`) — a topic-co-occurrence stand-in for the
  originally planned embedding similarity, using data M1 extraction already produces
  rather than standing up a separate embedding model/API key. 171 topics already have 2+
  show coverage across the full 2199-episode corpus, enough for the ranking to be
  meaningful (e.g. Casefile True Crime ↔ The Casual Criminalist: 63 shared topics).
  Revisit with real embeddings if co-occurrence ever proves too coarse (e.g. it can't
  distinguish "both cover serial killers" from "both cover the *same* serial killer" the
  way claims comparison's per-topic transcript reading can).
- **Related topics (done, first cut, 0.8.0):** same idiom one level down — each topic
  page lists other topics that co-occur in the same episodes (`web.related_topics()`),
  ranked by shared episode count. Caught a real data bug in the process: topic 236's
  label was "Fred Wes" — not a hark extraction error, but a typo in Wikidata's own
  entity label for the correct QID, mirrored faithfully into hark's own `topics.label`.
  Corrected locally; the case for this pattern (a name showing up truncated/misspelled
  purely because the *upstream* Wikidata label is wrong) is worth remembering if it
  recurs — check the actual Wikidata entity before assuming hark's extraction is at
  fault.
- **Notable back-catalog episodes (done, interim, 0.10.0):** `/notable` — explicitly
  labeled provisional, not M4's real interestingness scoring. Two distinct signals that
  don't just repeat the home page's cross-show-coverage ranking: "most contested" (topics
  with a loaded claims comparison, ranked by how many claims are unique to one show rather
  than shared — `web.contested_topics()`) and "rare coverage" (episodes in hark's two
  least-common genres by topic count — `web.rare_genre_episodes()`). Revisit once M4 ships
  real metrics; this page's framing should shift from "here's what we can derive" to
  "here's what's actually rated highly."
- **Candidate-show pipeline (done, first cut, 0.10.0):** `hark discover [--genre G] [--add]`
  — cheap signal is an iTunes Search sweep over a curated seed-term list per hark genre
  (`discover.SEED_TERMS`), deduplicated against already-tracked shows by feed_url. Reports
  candidates ranked by episode count; report-only by default, `--add` registers them
  (same `resolve.add_show_by_feed_url()` bare-row path as sync-subscriptions/import-opml).
  "Deeper analysis only for shows that pass" isn't a second automated stage — it's the
  owner's review of the reported list, then the existing ingest/extract pipeline once a
  candidate is actually added, same as any other show.

## M3 — AntennaPod loop (done, 0.10.0)

- **Subscriptions:** `hark sync-subscriptions` reads Nextcloud's GPodder Sync app
  (`nextcloud.py`) — `GET /index.php/apps/gpoddersync/subscriptions` returns a full
  add/remove history, not a live snapshot; "currently subscribed" is `add − remove`.
  Registers any feed URL not already a known show (bare row, same as OPML import —
  title/description/image get filled in by the next `hark ingest`). Deliberately never
  removes a show on gpodder-side unsubscribe: hark's topic index is meant to be a durable
  "who covered X" record independent of current subscription state.
- **Listen history:** `hark sync-history` pulls `episode_action` events (play position,
  timestamps) into a new `listen_actions` table — nothing reads it yet, it's there for M4's
  "calibrated against the owner's actual listening" scoring. Incremental via a stored
  cursor (`sync_state` table + GPodder Sync's own `since=<timestamp>` param), since this
  list only grows (2935 actions in the real account at the time this was built) — a full
  refetch every run would be wasteful.
- **OPML import fallback:** `hark import-opml <file>` — same `add_show_by_feed_url()` path,
  for a one-off OPML export instead of (or alongside) the live Nextcloud account.
- **Deployed pipeline integration:** the `transcribe` service's compose command runs
  `sync-subscriptions`/`sync-history` once at container start (before the fsck/transcribe/
  compare loop) rather than every cycle — subscriptions change rarely enough that
  once-per-restart is a reasonable cadence for v1; a real periodic mechanism (cron-style
  interval independent of restarts) is a cheap follow-up if that ever proves too coarse.
- **TLS:** the deployed Nextcloud instance uses a self-signed cert (LAN-only service) —
  `--nextcloud-insecure`/`$HARK_NEXTCLOUD_INSECURE` opts out of verification for that one
  connection specifically (`make_nextcloud_client()`, separate from `make_client()`, which
  stays fully verifying for every other caller: Anthropic, iTunes, HF Hub, podcast feed
  hosts). Defaults to verifying; the deployed container sets the opt-out explicitly.
- Generate custom RSS feeds as the recommendation delivery channel: not built — no
  "recommended for you" feature exists yet to generate a feed *for*. Revisit once M2's
  discovery signals (or M4's scoring) actually produce a ranked list worth delivering this
  way, rather than building the delivery mechanism first.

## M4 — episode scoring (tiltmeter-style)

- Defined interestingness metrics, calibration loop against owner ratings.
- Per-topic treatment comparison (depth, sensationalism) — needs transcripts for
  fidelity. Whisper is already available via the adscrub dependency (see above);
  this milestone should call `adscrub.transcribe`'s functions the same way the
  ad-stripping pipeline does, not stand up its own transcription path.

## Seed shows (feeds.txt)

Start with well-known subject-per-episode shows across two genres, e.g.: Casefile,
Casual Criminalist, Swindled, The Rest Is History, Short History Of, Cautionary Tales.
Resolve their real feed URLs via iTunes Search API at runtime — do not hand-copy URLs.

## Open questions (owner input needed, don't block on these)

- ~~Hosting~~ Resolved 2026-07-10: private Gitea (`flan/hark`); revisit GitHub if it goes public.
- Which LLM/provider for extraction (M1 decision).
- ~~GPU/Whisper feasibility~~ Resolved 2026-07-11: `code` has a real GPU, Docker's
  `nvidia` runtime is registered — see the adscrub dependency section above.
- ~~How to make the adscrub path dependency work in the Docker build~~ Resolved
  2026-07-11: `scripts/build-image.sh`, see the ad-stripping section above.
- `hark detect-ads` currently defaults to `claude-opus-4-8`; revisit cost vs.
  accuracy on ad-span boundaries once run against real transcripts.
- ~~When to actually wire the gpodder/Nextcloud subscription sync~~ Resolved 2026-07-12:
  M3 shipped in 0.10.0 — see above.
